# Weekly Project: AI Joke Generator
Lesson 8 -Generating jokes using AI


To consolidate the knowledge acquired this week, students should complete the following project:

## Project Instructions

1. **Create a GitHub repository** for your project.
2. **Add all members of your group as collaborators** in the repository.
3. **Create a `README.md` file** with a description of your project.
4. **Create a new application from scratch using NextJS.**
5. **Develop a page for generating jokes using AI.**

## Features to Implement

- **Customizable Joke Parameters:**
  - Allow users to customize the joke by selecting different parameters. Consider offering options such as:
    - **Topic:** Users can choose from a list (e.g., work, people, animals, food, television, etc.).
    - **Tone:** Select a tone for the joke (e.g., witty, sarcastic, silly, dark, goofy, etc.).
    - **Type of Joke:** Users can pick the joke format (e.g., pun, knock-knock, story, etc.).
    - **Temperature:** Control the randomness/creativity of the joke.
  - Construct the prompt for the AI model to adhere to these parameters.

- **Generate and Display Jokes:**
  - After configuring the parameters, users should click a button to generate the joke.
  - Display the generated response on the user's screen within the same page.

- **AI Evaluation Feature:**
  - Add functionality for the AI to evaluate whether the generated jokes are "funny", "appropriate", "offensive", or any other criteria you consider important.
  - Experiment with different prompts and system instructions to optimize AI models for subjective classification tasks like humor, appropriateness, offensiveness, etc.
